## Prerequisites
An accessible Rasperry Pi with an installed and updated OS. I had [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) (64-bit) installed which is based on Debian Linux although what you choose is up to you just make sure you know the commands for that particular distro or OS.
